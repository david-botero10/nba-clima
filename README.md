# NBA AND WEATHER

### This is my first console application.

The idea arose after want to learn a little more about NodeJs and be able to consume an API, One of my passions is the Nba, that's why I chose to consume a basic equipment API and although it does not have much to do with obtaining the current climate of the city.

With this app you can get the followings outputs:

- Name of Team
- Name of Conference
- City of Team
- Wheater Status
